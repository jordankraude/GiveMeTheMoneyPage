# Donation Platform Overview

As a software engineer, my primary goal is continuous learning and improvement. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript by building a donation platform that integrates with payment processing services to facilitate secure donations. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript language features, asynchronous programming, and handling real-world transactions.

## Description

The software I developed is a web application that utilizes JavaScript, Node.js with Express, and Axios for making HTTP requests to the payment processing API (e.g., Stripe). It features a user-friendly interface where donors can contribute funds securely and efficiently. The application supports different donation methods, including seamless donations and third-party payment processing. It also includes functionality for success and cancellation handling after a donation attempt.

## Purpose

The purpose of developing this software was to enhance my skills in JavaScript programming and web development. By working on this project, I aimed to:

- Solidify my understanding of JavaScript syntax and asynchronous operations.
- Gain practical experience in integrating with third-party payment APIs and handling API responses.
- Improve my proficiency in front-end development with React (Next.js) and Tailwind CSS.
- Showcase my ability to build a responsive and functional web application for handling financial transactions.
